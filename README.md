## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your computer and navigate into the directory.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ARAromal/tomato-leaf-detector.git](https://github.com/ARAromal/tomato-leaf-detector.git)
cd tomato-leaf-detector
```

2. Download the Dataset (Important)

This repository does not include the dataset due to its large size.

Unzip the file. You should have a tomato folder that contains another tomato folder inside it. Place this top-level tomato folder inside your project directory.

The final structure should be: .../tomato-leaf-detector/tomato/tomato/train.

3. Set Up the Environment

Next, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
py -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Web Application

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Use the App

Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
```bash
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
```
```bash
After you commit this change, your `README.md` will look complete and professional. ‚úÖ
