## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ARAromal/tomato-leaf-detector.git](https://github.com/ARAromal/tomato-leaf-detector.git)
cd tomato-leaf-detector

2. Download the Dataset (Important)
This repository does not include the dataset due to its large size.

Download the dataset from this Kaggle link.

Unzip the file. You should have a tomato folder that contains another tomato folder inside it. Place this top-level tomato folder inside your project directory.

The final structure should be: .../tomato-leaf-detector/tomato/tomato/train.

3. Set Up the Environment
# Create a virtual environment
py -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Web Application
python app.py
